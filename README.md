# Movie Website

The **Movie_Website** is a website showing trailers of six different movies. In addition to the title, the storyline and the picture of the film, a trailer of the film will also be played. This is done by _clicking_ on the picture.

## Quickstart

To open the page first start the python file: **entertainment_center. py**. The website with the trailers will then open.


## Structure of the code

The code consists of three python files:

- _entertainment_center.py_
This file contains a list of all information necessary for the Movie Trailer website: Title, storyline, picture of the              film and the trailer.

- _media.py_
This file contains the 'class' which stores the information about the trailers.

- _fresh_tomatoes.py_
This file takes the information about the trailers from the two files mentioned above  as an input and creates an HTML file that displays this information.
